Pong Game I have written in Python. There are still two errors that I need to iron name
1) The paddles respond to a single key press meaning that if you want to move them you have to press the up and down arrow keys multiple times
2) If the ball passes the paddle but is still close to either the top or the bottom of the paddle, the ball will zig zag along the paddle and then bounce off
